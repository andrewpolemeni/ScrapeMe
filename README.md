# ScrapeMe
A work in Progress: 
A restful API that accepts URL and CSS Selector, proccesses the input to a puppeteer function, and post to JSON.

Currently not working link to example: https://scrapeme.firebaseapp.com/
Firebase will not post since default is index.html.
A front end interface would help with fetching the data on POST.

# Install
npm install
 
 # Run
 node easy.js or nodemon easy.js
